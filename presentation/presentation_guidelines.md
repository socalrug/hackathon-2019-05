# Presentation Guidelines

## Overview

On Sunday afternoon, all teams will prepare and present a final presentation covering their work during the hackathon, highlighting the insights and conclusions they found within the data set.  The presentations will be presented to a panel of judges who will then award prizes in three categories:

* Best Insight
* Best Visualization
* Best Model

All teams that present will be eligible for the *Best Insight* award.  Any team that presents a visualization and/or modeling results will also be eligible for the *Best Visualization* and *Best Model* awards.  Though visualizations in particular are highly encouraged for all presentations, teams are not required to use either visualizations or models in their presentations.

In addition to the presentation awards above, we will also be awarding a prize to the *Most Helpful Person*, as voted upon by the hackathon participants.

## Presentations
All teams will need to make a presentation covering their work during the hackathon, highlighting the *insights*, *visualizations* and/or *models* they developed during the event.  

* Each team should prepare a PDF version of their presentation, produced with any software package (e.g. PowerPoint, Keynote, Shiny RMarkdown, etc.)
* Presentations must be submitted by 2 PM on Sunday. Submission details will be covered at the hackathon.
* Each team will have 5 minutes to present.  Due to the number of teams that will present and time restrictions, presentations will be stopped promptly at 5 minutes.
* There is no specific limit to the number of pages/slides for presentations as long as the presentation can fit within the 5 minute time limit.
* Each team will present from a team member’s laptop to the main projector screen in the presentation room.
* Teams that use interactive visualizations should embed a screenshot of the visualization in their PDF presentation, and show the actual visualization during the presentation.

## Tips for presentations:

* We will have 1 hour set aside specifically for preparing presentations after lunch on Sunday, from 1 — 2PM.
* However, be thinking about your presentation throughout the event and start preparations early.
* Simple and clear presentations are often more effective than more complex presentations.
* Teams only have 5 minutes to present so strive to present a clear message that can be delivered within the time limit.  This likely translates to presentations with 2 or 3 slides.
* Decide in advance which laptop your team will be present from.
* Decide in advance who will speak during the presentation.
* Practice your presentation at least one time to get a feel for timing and content.
