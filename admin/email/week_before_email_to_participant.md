# OCRUG 2019 Hackathon Preparation

## Pre-hackathon Setup

To make the most of your time, there are a number of things that you should do to prepare for the event.

1. Carefully read the [README](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/README.md) file for the event.
1. OCRUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free environment. Please read and abide by the [OCRUG Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).
1. We will be using [slack.com](https://slack.com/) during the event. 
    1. If you are not on the [OCRUG Slack channel](https://ocrug.slack.com) please [sign-up](https://ocrug-slack.herokuapp.com/). 
    1. Join the **hackathon-2019** channel in slack. This is a great place to get help in getting set-up for the hackathon.
1. Information for the hackathon is kept in the [hackathon-2019](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019) GitHub repo. You will need to install *git* / *GitBash*, have an ssh key and a GitHub account. The following section will help you do that.
    1. You will *git* installed. In Windows it referred to as **GitBash**. For instructions on doing installing it in Windows, we have created a [guide](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/setup/git%20for%20Windows/git%20for%20Windows.pdf) or you can use this [tutorial](https://www.onlinetutorialspoint.com/git/how-to-install-git-windows-10-operating-system.html). On Windows 10 you can also install it in the Ubuntu console. For the Mac, [download the installer](https://sourceforge.net/projects/git-osx-installer/files/).
    1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join), if you do not have one.
    1. You will need a *ssh key*. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) to create one. Make sure you choose your OS at the top.
    1. Your *ssh key* needs to be registered in your GitHub account. Follow these [instructions](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) to add your public *ssh key* to your GitHub account. Make sure you choose your OS at the top. 
    1. Clone the hackathon repo. Go to a command line terminal (Linux/Mac) or *GitBash* in Windows. There are two ways to do this, do **not** use the *https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019.git* URL. Instead, use the following command:
```
git clone git@github.com:ocrug/hackathon-2019.git
```
1. One of the tutorials will teach you how to run RStudio on AWS. This will give you the option to use larger machines to do your work. You can also use EMR (Spark / Hadoop) with R if you wish. There will be AWS credits that should cover the costs for most people. You can set up an account and the credits can be applied retroactively to the beginning of the billing cycle (i.e. the start of the month). [Create an AWS Account and IAM user](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/setup/Create%20AWS%20Account%20and%20IAM%20user/Create%20an%20aws%20account%20and%20an%20IAM%20user.pdf). If you plan to use your computer then this is optional.
1. Run the [check_setup.r](https://github.com/ocrug/hackathon-2019/blob/master/check_setup.r) script. It will make sure that you have the basic libraries installed and updated software. **This can take quite a while to run**.
