# Judging Guidelines

## Best Insight
* All teams that present their work will be eligible for the *Best Insight* award.
* An *insight* will be considered as piece of “knowledge” gained through the analysis of the hackathon data set.  This could include, for example:
	* an interesting conclusion or understanding about the data
	* a recommendation or suggestion about how something could be changed or done differently, supported by data analysis
	* a link or association between information in the data, particularly ones that are unexpected or non-intuitive
* Insights will be judged based upon how much practical impact the insight could have on the subject of the hackathon data set, and how well the associated analysis supports it.

## Best Visualization
* Any team that presents a visualization as part of their final submission is eligible for the *Best Visualization* award.
* Visualizations can be either static graphics (e.g. a plot or 2-D graphic), or an interactive/dynamic visualization (e.g. a web page or a Shiny application with graphics components).
* Visualizations will be judged primarily on their ability to clearly convey an interesting and/or insightful aspect of the hackathon data set.  Factors include:
	* how the data is used to communicate interesting aspects of the data in visual form
	* the ability for someone not familiar with the data to understand (with the accompanying presentation) the main points of the visualization
	* the effective use of data graphics principles including, for example, the use of statistical summarizations, color, data subsetting, data highlighting, etc.
	* For static graphics, overly complex visualizations that detract from understanding the points of the visualization should be avoided.
	* for interactive/dynamic graphics, the interactive aspect should be a fundamental component to understanding the points of the visualization.  Interactivity for interactivity-sake should be avoided.
	* interactive graphics will not be judged as “better” than static graphics simply because they are interactive.

## Best Model
* Any team that presents results of their work that were obtained using statistical modeling will be eligible for the *Best Model* award.
* Any data modeling method can be used, including:
	* Linear regression, logistic regression, and other common statistical models
	* Machine learning models and algorithms such as decisions trees, Random Forest, support vector machines (SVM), and neural networks
* Teams presenting modeling results should also report an assessment of model performance (e.g. RMSE, confusion matrices/TPR/FPR/accuracy, ROC AUC, etc). 
* Models will be judged based the underlying question the model is trying to address, the interpretation of the results, the performance of the model, and the validity of the methods used to derive the model.

## Most Helpful Person

* In addition to the team presentations, the *Most Helpful Person* award will be awarded to the most helpful person at the event, as voted upon by the hackathon participants.
* Before lunch on Sunday, participants will vote for the most helpful person.  The person with the most votes will recieve the *Most Helpful Person* award.
* Each participant will be given 10 points that they can distribute as they like to any other participant, except themselves. The participant with the most points will be awarded the prize.
